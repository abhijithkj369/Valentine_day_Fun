# Valentine's Day Fun (React Version) ❤️

A delightful collection of interactive Valentine's Day themed games built with React and Vite. Perfect for sharing with your special someone!

## 🎮 Games Included

1.  **Will you be my Valentine? 💌**
    -   A playful implementation where the "Yes" button runs away from the cursor! Can you catch it?
    -   (Tip: It stops running after a few tries 😉)

2.  **Love Calculator 💘**
    -   Enter two names to calculate your compatibility percentage.
    -   Uses a consistent algorithm so the same names always get the same result!

3.  **Memory Match 🎴**
    -   A classic memory card game with a romantic twist.
    -   Cards are arranged in a **Heart Shape** grid for extra cuteness!

4.  **Catch the Hearts 🧺**
